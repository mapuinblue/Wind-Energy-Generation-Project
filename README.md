# **Wind Energy Generation Potential Analysis in Colombian Cities**  

### **Introduction**  
This project analyzes wind speed data from multiple Colombian cities to evaluate their potential for renewable wind energy generation. By employing advanced statistical models and techniques, it builds on a prior analysis that used only the Weibull distribution. This enhanced version leverages Python and incorporates **Generalized Extreme Value (GEV)**, as well as **Kernel Density Estimation (KDE)**, providing a more comprehensive and flexible framework to assess wind patterns.  

The first iteration of this project, developed in R, served as the foundation for this improved analysis. By integrating more advanced tools and techniques in Python, this version highlights my ability to adapt and refine methodologies to generate more accurate and actionable insights.

### **Purpose**  
The purpose of this project is to identify optimal locations for wind energy projects in Colombia by accurately characterizing wind speed patterns across selected cities. This analysis provides key insights to stakeholders for:
- Turbine placement and design.
- Risk assessment of extreme wind events.
- Prioritization of regions with high potential for energy generation.  

### **Objectives**  
1. **Explore Wind Speed Variability**: Evaluate the variability and central tendencies of wind speeds for each city.  
2. **Model Wind Speed Distributions**: Utilize advanced statistical methods (GEV, Log-Normal, and KDE) to characterize wind speed distributions.  
3. **Quantify Energy Potential**: Assess probabilities for critical metrics, such as the 60th percentile wind speed and interquartile ranges (IQR).  
4. **Optimize Decision-Making**: Provide actionable recommendations for wind energy project planning.

### **Metrics, Formulas, and Models Used**  

#### **Metrics**
- **Coefficient of Variation (CV)**: Measures relative variability of wind speeds and temperatures.  
- **Percentiles**: 60th percentile to identify conditions exceeding moderate wind speeds.  
- **Interquartile Range (IQR)**: Highlights the spread of central wind speeds (Q3 - Q1).  

#### **Models Used**
- **Generalized Extreme Value (GEV)**: Captures extreme wind events for cities like Riohacha, critical for maximum energy generation.  
- **Kernel Density Estimation (KDE)**: Provides a flexible, data-driven representation of wind speed distributions for all cities.

### **Conclusions**  

#### **Key Insights**:
- **Riohacha**: High variability and frequent extreme winds make it ideal for peak energy generation projects. Requires robust infrastructure.  
- **Santa Marta and Cartagena**: Moderate skewness indicates steady wind conditions, with occasional high-speed outliers providing additional energy potential.  
- **General Trends**: Most cities exhibit probabilities close to 50% for wind speeds between Q1 and Q3, suggesting relatively stable conditions.  

#### **Recommendations for Stakeholders**:
1. **Robust Turbines for High Variability**: Riohacha and Valledupar require advanced turbine designs to handle fluctuating and extreme wind speeds.  
2. **Steady Output Locations**: Santa Marta, Cartagena, and Bucaramanga are suited for consistent energy generation.  
3. **Flexible Modeling**: Integrating GEV, Log-Normal, and KDE provides tailored insights for each city, improving decision-making and planning accuracy.  

### **Project Impact**  
This project highlights my ability to analyze large datasets (17,342 records), apply advanced statistical and probabilistic methods, and deliver actionable insights for renewable energy projects. The shift from R to Python in this enhanced version demonstrates my adaptability and commitment to leveraging the best tools for robust data analysis.  

**Skills Demonstrated**:  
- Advanced statistical modeling (GEV, Log-Normal, KDE).  
- Data visualization and exploratory data analysis.  
- Management of large datasets.  
- Team leadership and project execution, coordinating with a team of five in the original project version.  

This project showcases my readiness to take on challenging roles in data analysis and science, especially in domains requiring complex statistical insights and decision-making support.
